# Docker Fundamentals Self-Teach
# Course in colab with Perplexity built with prompts 30.01.2026

Berlin tech night edition with Perplexity. Fundamentals-first for Wildfly23 → K8s migration.

## Environment
- OS: LMDE 6 (faye) / Linux 6.1.0-42-amd64
- Docker: 20.10.24
- Git: 2.39.5

## Session Flow
1. Baseline quiz (images/containers/layers)
2. Hands-on: Hello World → Dockerfile → volumes/networking
3. Problem-solving (PID1, bloat, leaks)
4. Wildfly containerization bridge

AI generated everything above. I want to see how well AI can teach. So, now I'm asking it to teach me Docker. 
I know that AI isn't sentient, nor that it really understands what it's talking about. But I'd like to see what kind
of mentor it can be. So, I gave it this challenge, "teach me docker and find out where my holes are in understanding this tech."
And it's trying. Let's see if I can keep up with it. 

I've decided to put this in version control just as a way to do a two-fer: get better at git AND docker at the same time. 

Update: After about three hours, I've come to the conlusion that this is pretty much a waste of time. Perplexity is a terrible tutor that can't see or understand
its own limitations. It provides example commands that don't work and then we spiral into a back and forth that just keeps circling the drain. Even worse, 
it doesn't understand that IT has provided nonfunctional commands, and keeps providing solutions as if the failures are mine. It's weird and deeply off-putting.
